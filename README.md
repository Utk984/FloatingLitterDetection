# Marine Debris (litter) Detection Using Deep Learning

This project uses deep learning to automate the detection of floating marine debris, supporting autonomous systems like UAVs and USVs in real-time waste monitoring. Marine debris poses a severe threat to aquatic life and ecosystems, with millions of tons of waste entering waterways each year. Traditional debris management methods are labor-intensive and limited in scope. By leveraging advanced object detection models, this project enhances debris identification even in complex, cluttered, and varying environmental conditions.

## Overview

- Objective: Develop a reliable system for detecting floating waste in diverse and challenging aquatic environments.
- Key Features: 
  - Improved accuracy on small objects, addressing the challenge of detecting fragments and microplastics.
  - Lighting adaptation to handle variations in brightness, glare, and reflections.
  - Increased robustness through diverse datasets, enabling the model to perform well across different water bodies and lighting conditions.

## Datasets

The project integrates five key datasets to capture a wide range of debris and conditions:
- FloW-IMG: High-resolution images with a focus on small debris objects.
- FloatingWaste-IN: Images taken under different lighting conditions, with reduced background reflections.
- Floating Waste Dataset: Augmented images simulating real-world conditions for enhanced model training.
- Floating Plastic: Complex real-world scenarios with plastic debris in narrow waterways.
- TUD-GV: Diverse litter types captured at different heights and weather conditions.
